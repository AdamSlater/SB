PROJECT OVERVIEW
---------------------
Simon's Besom

Simon's Besom is a Simon Says and Minesweeper crossover that will train the user's 
mind in memory and speed. The game is set in an X by X grid and will adjust it's size 
according to how the player is doing. The player will be racing against the clock 
attempting to replicate the path in the same order as they appeared. Each level is 
randomly generated and increases in difficulty as you progress(an increase in grid 
size or longer path to memorize).

ISSUES/PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
-----------------------------

Time constraints - Choices had to be made and features had to be cut in order to meet deadlines.
Version control - Github often created code conflicts that had to constantly be sorted out.
Lack of direction - In the beginning before we had to implement the scrum model there was a lack
                    of direction leading to differences of opinion and slow progress.
Couldn't break up tasks - Found it hard to break up larger tasks into smaller components. Leading to
                    a severe lack of consistency of the length of each task and causing
                    some members to be assigned more work after each scrum.
